# Toadstool

Python load tools -- An opinionated solution for cleanly loading files directly into Python objects.

This library works by creating custom Python finders and loaders and injecting them into the Python meta search path.

The Python import system is explained in great detail [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-import-system).

## Requirements

Requires Python 3.10

## Install

### Basic Install

`$ python3 -m pip install toadstool`

### Advanced Install

`$ python3 -m pip install toadstool[options]`
Where `options` are any of the following (or combinations thereof):

* `toml` For `.toml` support for Python versions prior to `Python 3.11`, which introduced `tomllib` into the standard library
* `yaml` For `.yaml` support
* `gql` For `.gql` or `.graphql` query support using `graphql-core` library

## Usage

To use this module, simply `import toadstool` before any import you wish to use the included loaders for. This can be at the top of your source file or just before any imports for the supported filetypes.

## Loaders

<details>
  <summary>GraphQL</summary>

Load graphql queries directly as graphql.language.ast.DocumentNode objects from the [GraphQL Core Library](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-core/tree/main/src/graphql).  Allows direct importing of queries/mutations/subscriptions/fragments (aka GraphQL operations).

Example:

Given a GraphQL query file names `queries.graphl` or `queries.gql` with the following contents:

```graphql
query HeroComparison($first: Int = 3) {
  leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
  rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
}

fragment comparisonFields on Character {
  name
  friendsConnection(first: $first) {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

mutation CreateReviewForEpisode($ep: Episode!, $review: ReviewInput!) {
  createReview(episode: $ep, review: $review) {
    stars
    commentary
  }
}
```

then you can import the contents of the file either as a whole module:

```python
import queries
print(queries.__dict__)

>
{'__name__': 'queries', '__doc__': None, '__package__': '', '__loader__': GqlImporter('queries.gql'), '__spec__': ModuleSpec(name='queries', loader=GqlImporter('queries.gql')), 'HeroComparison': DocumentNode, 'operations': {'HeroComparison': DocumentNode}, '__file__': 'queries.gql'}
```

or using specific query names:

```python
from queries import HeroComparison
print(HeroComparison.definitions)

> (OperationDefinitionNode at 0:180, FragmentDefinitionNode at 182:339)
```

Also tracks all operations in a module dict as `queries.operations`

<details>
  <summary>JSON</summary>

Loads JSON objects using builtin `json` library. The top-level JSON keys are stored as attirbutes for the module and the whole `json` converted `dict` is stored as `imported_name.json` For example, the following file `sample.json`

```json
{
    "employee": {
        "name":       "sonoo",
        "salary":      56000,
        "married":    true
    },
    "menu": {
        "id": "file",
        "value": "File",
        "popup": {
          "menuitem": [
            {"value": "New", "onclick": "CreateDoc()"},
            {"value": "Open", "onclick": "OpenDoc()"},
            {"value": "Save", "onclick": "SaveDoc()"}
          ]
        }
      }
}
```

can be loaded and used in the following way:

```python
import toadstool
import sample

>>> sample.
sample.employee  sample.json      sample.menu
print(sample.menu)
> {'id': 'file', 'value': 'File', 'popup': {'menuitem': [{'value': 'New', 'onclick': 'CreateDoc()'}, {'value': 'Open', 'onclick': 'OpenDoc()'}, {'value': 'Save', 'onclick': 'SaveDoc()'}]}}
```

You also have the json root object available at `sample.json`:

```python
import toadstool
import sample

print(sample.json)
>{'employee': {'name': 'sonoo', 'salary': 56000, 'married': True}, 'menu': {'id': 'file', 'value': 'File', 'popup': {'menuitem': [{'value': 'New', 'onclick': 'CreateDoc()'}, {'value': 'Open', 'onclick': 'OpenDoc()'}, {'value': 'Save', 'onclick': 'SaveDoc()'}]}}}
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>TOML</summary>

  Loads TOML files such that each top-level table becomes an attribute of the imported module. Also loads the whole TOML file as a dictionary under the `toml` attirbute (which will overwrite any table from the file with the name `toml` as well). For example, if you have `example.toml` with the following contents:

  ```toml
  [project]
  name = 'Toadstool'
  description = 'Python Load Tools Suite'
  readme = 'README.md'
  requires-python = "~=3.10"
  license = { file = 'LICENSE' }
  version = '0.1.0'
  authors = [{ name = 'AndrÃ©s Alejos', email = 'acalejos@proton.me' }]
  classifiers = [
      'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT Licens',
      'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
      'Topic :: Software Development',
      'Topic :: Utilities',
  ]
  keywords = ["import", "loader", "meta", "sys"]
  urls = { Home = "https://github.com/acalejos/toadstool" }

  [project.optional-dependencies]
  gql = ['graphql_core>=3.2.3']
  yaml = ['pyyaml >= 5.3.1']
  toml = ['toml >= 0.10.2;python_version < "3.11"']
  all = ['toadstool[gql]', 'toadstool[yaml]', 'toadstool[toml]']

  [sample]
  name = 'Sample'

  [[Root]]
  name = 'Root'
  ```

  can be loaded and used in the following way:

```python
import toadstool
import example

>>> example.
example.Root     example.project  example.sample   example.toml
```

## ToadContext

Located in `toadstool.utils.utils`, ToadContext is a Context Manager to allow imports with `toadstool` loaders without permanently changing the `sys.meta_path`.  Using this, you can import your files the same way as you would using `import toadstool` from within a context without having to actually import `toadstool`. You must explicitly pass loaders you wish to use as arguments.

This context manager does not yield anything, so the proper usage is:

```python
with ToadContext(Loader | list(Loaders)):
    import my_module
```

## Contributing

Feel free to open feature requests for new features or simply supported file extensions. If you feel so inclined, you can also open up a pull request to merge in your own loader. Creating a new loader is very straight forwards and can be accomplished by:

* Creating a file in `toadstool/loaders` with the name `{filetype}_loader.py`
* Implementing a class that inherits from the `Loader` class located in `toadstool/loaders/base_loader`. Your class must implement the following:

  * Simply call the `super()` `find_spec` method specifying your file extension(s) either as a `str` for a single extension or `list[str]` for multiple extensions

  ```python
  @classmethod
  def find_spec(cls, name, path, target=None):
      """Look for file"""
      return super().find_spec(name,path,target,file_exts={your_file_extension})
  ```

  * Define `def exec_module(self, module):` where your functionality will be implemented. This will typically look like updating the `module.__dict__` with values according to how you load the file
* If your loader has dependencies:
  * Specify a new optional dependency in `pyrpoject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]`
  * Add your dependency to the `all` optional dependency by adding it as `toadstool[your_dep]`
* Add your loader to the list `all_loaders` in the root `__init__.py` file as a 3-tuple with:
  * Path to your module in dotted notation
  * Name of your loader class
  * Name of dependency from `pyrpoject.toml` if it exists or `None`

Refer to any of the existing loaders in `toadstool/loaders` for examples
